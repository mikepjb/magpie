# Magpie Design

A twitter bot that will:
  - [ ] markov generate new content
  - [ ] retweet popular tweets by set of users
    - [ ] retweet with an additive message
  - [ ] breakdown my blog posts and post quotes
    - [ ] blog served using json
  - [ ] asks a question

## Architecture

Runtime - lambda or a small GCP/AWS box

- [ ] Able to run and print to console instead of live tweeting
- [ ] Secrets stored in environment variables
  - [ ] How is this done with Lambda/GCP?
